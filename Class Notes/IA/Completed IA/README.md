# Your own private repo
Use this for all your individual assignment submission. You can also use this for storing other work, but do not alter the names and location of the following folders (one for each individual assignment)

IA01
IA02
IA03
IA04
IA05
IA06
IA07
IA08

Try to keep this directory clean and tidy. If you want to store other, non-assignment, files - create another subdirectory.
