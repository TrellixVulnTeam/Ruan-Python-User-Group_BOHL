# Individual Assignment #1, due Sept. 2, 2016 by 7:55 AM

## E1. Add to your existing private repo

After the work we did in W01C03, you should have a cloned version of your MIS407-10xx repo local to your drive. If you do 
not, to begin this assignment you will need to clone your private repo to your local hardrive.

Add a README.md file to you IA01 folder. 

In the README.md file create a code block (see the markdown cheat sheet that I linked to in notes) that lists the commands 
necessary to accomplish each of the following tasks.

a) clone your personal repo to your local drive

b) add any changes to the staging area

c) tag the changes as IA01_v1 

d) commit the changes with the message "Add Individual Assignment #1 files"

e) push your changes to the server.

One you have created this README.md file, then execute the commands necessary to stage, tag as IA01_v1 (v2, v3 etc if you need to 
try multiple times to get this correct), commit, and push the changes to your personal repo (MIS407-10xx) back to your GitHub repo.


## E2. Add to a class repo (in this case, IA-test-repo)

I've created a test repo called "IA01-test-repo"

Submit a pull request that adds a folder FNAME_LNAME containing a README.md file. Put any questions/comments you want in 
this file - or say, "Nothing at this time".

NOTE: There are multiple ways of accomplish #2. You will most likely need to review the GitHub and Git Book sources mentioned in class. 

##NOTE: You don't need to notify me when you are done. I'll mark your last commits made prior to the deadline.
