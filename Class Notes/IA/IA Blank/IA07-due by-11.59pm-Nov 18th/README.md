# IA07: Developing a Linear Predictive Model using Scilearn-kit

Using the Scikit-learn and numpy python packages, analyze university an produce a linear predictive model (refer to c35, and c34 class notes and lecture)

Your objective for IA7 is to produce a report using Jupyter notebook.

To accomplish this task, you have been given the universities.csv data. Using this small sample of data, you will be develop a linear model that predicts student performance. You've been given three inputs to explore 1) Median SAT of students entering the program, 2) the acceptance rate of the program, and 3) the expenditures per student.

Your report (jupyter notebook) must include the following 5 items:

1. Title and introduction
1. Description of the data -Explore the data using a scatter plot showing the relationship between input value and target value. What patterns do you see?
1. Development and description of three simple linear models that look at each input.
1. Development and description of a multi-variable linear model that considers all inputs.
1. Discussion of your overall results, limitations, and recommendations for further development of a graduation rate prediction model.

NOTE1: The "description" for items 2 and 3 should include a scatterplot with a prediction line and at least one measure of fit.

NOTE2:
This project will require the use of pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. In previous lectures, we've installed pandas, numpy, and scipy.

To install skikit-learn:

```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
