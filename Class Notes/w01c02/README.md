# w01c01 Class Notes and Supplemental Material

In this class we cover the basics of local repository management.

We review three key workflows/tasks:

1. Creating a local repository, staging, and committing files.
2. Rolling back changes.
3. Managing experimental/test changes to your released code.

Be sure you should know  how to:

1. Initialize a repo, add files to staging area, and commit files to your repository.
2. Reset your repository to a previous commit point (only use this as a last resort -- proper branch management should help you avoid needing to do this)
3. List all branches, create a branch, know which branch you are one, and switch between branches.
