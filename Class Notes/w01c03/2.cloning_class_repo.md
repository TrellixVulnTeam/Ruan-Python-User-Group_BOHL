# Cloning the class notes and admin repo to your local drive

Much of the material for this course will be made available on the "Class Notes and Admin" repo on our MIS407-smith GitHub repo.

In this section, I will walk you through the process of cloning this repo to your local drive.

## Check your Git credentials

Before your clone this repo to your local drive, make sure you have the correct credentials set in your global environment.

```
git config --global --list
```

If name and email are incorrect,  see "git basics" from last class for how to set these.

## Clone your MIS407-cid10xx repo to your local drive.

Change to your MIS407 directory and load a command prompt (I'd recommend using Git Bash).

Using a web-browser, login to your GitHub account (the one you would have sent me via email). Select the clone button, and copy the URL to your repo.

Using your local command prompt, clone your repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/MIS407-smith/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

## Appendix:

As updated to the material occur, if you want to update your local copy (but, you can always access it on the server)

`` 
git pull
```

I encourage you to read up on how to merge content. More information on merging can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge)
