# Modules and Namespaces

In Python, all python .py files are modules. You start with one main .py file and tell python to run it. In any non-trivial program, this will set off a cascade of modules importing (running) of other modules.

A package is means to collect a number of modules together under one structure. A package is simply a directory of Python modules, but also containing an `__init__.py` file. The `__init__.py` is used to 'initialize' the package.   Without an `__init__.py` file, the directory is not a package, but rather a directory that just happens to contain a bunch of Python modules.

All of this is probably best illustrated through examples.

See Modules_Namespaces_Demo directory.

Can you explain what's going on? Take the time to look at this. Explore the code and the output.


### Appendix:

You can create you own packages and make them available to the Python community via PyPI. Read [here](http://mikegrouchy.com/blog/2012/05/be-pythonic-__init__py.html) for a brief information on how to do this.
