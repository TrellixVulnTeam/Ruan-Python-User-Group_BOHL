# Git rollback process

Though it's s not good practice to "rollback" to a previous version (it's best to always think about moving forward), there are times where the best approach is to "rollback" your code to a previous commit.

```
git log --pretty=oneline
git reset --hard 82a6dff817ec66f44342007202
ls
git status
git log
```
NOTE: The long number you see is cut and pasted from the commit that you wish to rollback to. You don't even need the entire number, just enough to uniquely identify the commit. You obtain this code from the output from the git log command.
