# w01c03 Class Notes and Supplemental Material

## In this class

In this class we cover the basics of remote repository management using GitHub.

We review the following:

1. The GitHub markdown language.
1. Cloning the course notes repo to your local drive.
1. Managing your MIS407 personal repo.
1. Creating "releases" of your repos content.
1. Contributing to someone else's repo (using a pull request).

Finally, I'll review the structure of the repositories we will be using for this course.

## By next class

By next class, be sure you know how to:

1. Clone a copy of the course material stored in GitHub
1. Submit individual assignments to  your personal repository for this course.
1. Submit and manage content on your team repositories.
1. Open issues, and make changes/add to the course content using Pull requests.

If you get stuck, or would like to learn more about using Git, refer to the Git book found here https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. Git is a handy tool to get to know. I'd encourage you to read more on it and experiment with using it for you class notes and other coding assignments.
