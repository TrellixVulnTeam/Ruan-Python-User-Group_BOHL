# TopHat

See Slack and Blackboard posting for more detail. You should all have an account setup with TopHat. As we have discussed, this requires you to have a license. These licenses can be purchased direct from TopHat or via the university bookstore. (NOTE: If you have an old turning point clicker, go through the bookstore - they are offering a trade in bonus)

## Testing TopHat

NOTE: Todays questions do not count. This is a test run of TopHat, barring any difficulties, we will be live for next class (Next class - these will count!)

<fire up you TopHat client -- and I'll run through a few questions>

If you have any questions/problems/issues, please refer to my posting on Slack and Blackboard. TopHat support will help you with any issues.
