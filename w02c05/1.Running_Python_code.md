# Running Python code.

Two ways to run Python code. The first is to run if from within the Python interpreter, or secondly, running code stored within a .py file.

## Interactive entry of code direct into the interpreter

You can run python code interactively within the python interpreter

From the windows command line, simply type the following:

```
U:\>python
Python 3.5.2 (v3.5.2:4def2a2901a5, Jun 25 2016, 22:01:18) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("HelloWorld!")
HelloWorld!
```

But, often you'll also want to run Python from the bash terminal. In Windows, to do this we need to win python using the following:

```
$ winpty python
Python 3.5.2 (v3.5.2:4def2a2901a5, Jun 25 2016, 22:01:18) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (In
tel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>>
```

## Running a Python source file

Though we can often use the python interpreters command line, we most often will want to run the code we write from a .py source file

```
$  echo 'print("Hello World!")' >> HelloWorld.py
$ python HelloWorld.py
Hello World!
```
