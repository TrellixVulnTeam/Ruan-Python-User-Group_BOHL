# Organizing Python

Unlike many other languages, in python, the file structure becomes part of the structure of your program.

First, let's discuss python package management.

## Python package management with pip

### PyPI

There are a plethora of useful packages available to assist you in  writing your Python program and achieving your objectives.

The Python community does a good job at organizing and distributing these packages through PyPI - the Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

>The Python Package Index is a repository of software for the Python programming language. There are currently 85831 packages here.". The index is managed by the Python Software Foundation (https://www.python.org/psf/)<

NOTE: Take a look around the PyPI. There are a great many useful packages to be found there. As we progress in this course, I'll have you download certain packages needed for our lectures.

### pip

Included with recent versions of python is the pip package management system (*Python 2.7.9 and later (on the python2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip (pip3 for Python 3) by default*) . Pip is used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Using pip you can install packages that you have downloaded yourself, but mostly, you'll use pip to install packages from  the Python Package Index [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

To test that you have access to pip type the following command.

```
pip --version
```
As of this writing, the latest version is pip 8.1.2. You can always update to the latest version using the following command:

```
python -m pip install -U pip
```

PIP - From Wikipedia... pip is a recursive acronym that can stand for either "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python".

>"pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Many packages can be found in the Python Package Index (PyPI). Python 2.7.9 and later (on the python2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip (pip3 for Python 3) by default."

"Wheel Files" - when a Python package is not available on PyPI, look for a "wheel" file. Pip can install wheel files by "pip install <wheelfile>". Wheel files are compiled to specific operating systems - for Windows, Christoph Gohlke's site has many, many, wheel files. http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

#### Install a package from the Python Package Index (PyPI)

Let's install a couple of useful packages from PyPI. Requests and BeautifulSoup4 packages help you 'screen scrape' (analyze and extract web page information) and process web content.

Using pip, we simply run the following commands.
```
pip install BeautifulSoup4
pip install requests
```

If successful, we should see something similar to what you see here:

```
$ pip install  BeautifulSoup4
Collecting BeautifulSoup4
  Downloading beautifulsoup4-4.5.1-py3-none-any.whl (83kB)
    100% |################################| 92kB 2.0MB/s
Installing collected packages: BeautifulSoup4
Successfully installed BeautifulSoup4-4.5.1
$ pip install requests
Collecting requests
  Downloading requests-2.11.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (514kB)
Installing collected packages: requests
Successfully installed requests-2.11.1
```


Let's now check our packages to make sure they have installed:

```
import bs4
import requests

webpage = requests.get("http://www.iastate.edu/")
soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(webpage.text, "html.parser")
print(soup.title.string)
```

NOTE: In the above snippet of code, we download the ISU homepage, and print the specified title of this page from the HTML code that we downloaded.

#### Installing a package that doesn't exist on PyPI

Since many Python modules/packages require compiled code, PiPI and pip may not have the appropriate files for your particularly version of operating system and platform. For windows, you can find compiled versions of many common libraries (for instance, numpy and openCV -- which we'll be using later) in a library maintained by [Christoph Gohlke](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/) (see: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/_). Chistoph's site has various compiled versions of libraries for each Windows operating system (x32 vs x86, older windows, etc).

Such compiled libraries are contained within "wheel" files. To install, you simply download the file and run the command:

```
pip install whatever_the_name.whl
```
