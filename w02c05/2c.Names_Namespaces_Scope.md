# Python names, Namespaces, and symbol tables

## What's in a Python name?

A name is Python is roughly similar to variables as you've seen in past languages. Two things that are a bit different though are a) dynamic typing, and b) they always name an object (everything is an object in Python).

As you'd expect, you can give names to values:

```
v = 1<2
w = 122
x = 12.2
y = "this is a test"
z = [10, 9, 8]
```

The dynamic nature is illustrated in the following:

```
z = 12
z = "This is twelve"
z = [5,6,7]
```

Since all names in Python name an object, Python can also offer the following:
```
z.append(8)
z.index(6)
```

To list the attributes and methods found within some of the:

```
>>> dir(w)
['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__bool__', '__ceil__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__float__', '__floor__', '__floordi
v__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__index__', '__init__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__le__', '__lshift__', '__l
t__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__rep
r__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__round__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '
__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__truediv__', '__trunc__', '__xor__', 'bit_length', 'conjugate', 'denominator', 'from_bytes', 'im
ag', 'numerator', 'real', 'to_bytes']

```

Now, taking one of these names (bit_length) from this object, we can do the following

```
>>> w.bit_length()
7
>>> w=255
>>> w.bit_length()
8
>>> w=34968
>>> w.bit_length()
16
```

I python, we also get the actual physical memory address where a variable is stored:

```
>>> id(w)
2437876371344
```

We'll be covering more on python data types next week, but for now, I just wanted to go over enough detail to understand some of the fundamentals of Python.


## Namespaces

Namespaces are sets of names, and the space for adding more names. This concept is closely related to symbol tables. Namespaces are implemented using symbol tables, but that are of a particular form that we can access their content as follows:

```
<namespace>.somevar
```

But, we can't do the following:

```
<function_name>.somevar)
```

## Scope

This is the extent to which a namespace applies.

Let's try an example piece of code:

```
def outer_function():
    a = 20
    def inner_function():
        a = 30
        print('a =',a)

    inner_function()
    print('a =',a)
a = 10
outer_function()
print('a =',a)
```

The output from this snippet of code is:
```
a = 30
a = 20
a = 10
```

```
def outer_function():
    global a
    a = 20
    def inner_function():
        global a
        a = 30
        print('a =',a)

    inner_function()
    print('a =',a)
a = 10
outer_function()
print('a =',a)
```

Can you guess the output from the above code? Here is what it is:

```
def outer_function():
    global a
    a = 20
    def inner_function():
        global a
        a = 30
        print('a =',a)

    inner_function()
    print('a =',a)
a = 10
outer_function()
print('a =',a)
```
